# simple-finance
Repo for the simple-finance app. 

## Design
So the idea here, I want to create a simple personal finance app. 
Allows you to track what your income sources are, what your costs are
You can allocate repeating costs. 
It would make sense to organize it as a calender? You can set dates for when your paycheck comes in. 
Set dates for when the rent is due, or different subscriptions are going to be due. 

### Charts
I think it would be great if it was a very visual app. Use charts to create And demonstrate your totals. Expenses and where your money is going. 

### What to do now
Create a landing page. 
Make a frontend for the app. Mockup of how things are going to look.
